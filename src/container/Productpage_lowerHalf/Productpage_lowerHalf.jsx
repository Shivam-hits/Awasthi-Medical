                Pantop 40 Tablet is a medicine that reduces the amount of acid produced in your stomach. It is used for treating acid-related diseases of the stomach and intestine such as heartburn, acid reflux, peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It provides relief from the symptoms and promotes healing.
                Pantop 40 Tablet is also used to prevent stomach ulcers and acidity that may be seen with the prolonged use of painkillers. It belongs to a class of medicines known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This medicine should be taken one hour before a meal, preferably in the morning. The dose will depend on your underlying condition and how you respond to the medicine. You should keep on taking it as prescribed even if your symptoms disappear quickly. You can increase the efficiency of the treatment by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee), and spicy or fatty foods.
                The most common side effects observed with this medicine include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, flatulence, diarrhea, and stomach pain. These symptoms are generally mild but if they bother you or do not go away, consult your doctor. Long-term use of this medicine may lead to an increased risk of side effects. For instance, using this medicine for more than 1 year may increase your risk for bone fractures, especially with higher doses. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis), like taking calcium and vitamin D supplements
                Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have ever had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or suffer from bone loss (osteoporosis). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it.
